      <description>ARcher The purpose of our application is to create an AR game that anyone can use in their home. In our case we use as basis the basic deck of card that almost everyone has. In our demo, we include 4 different kind of cards : 1) Ace of Spades 2) Two of Spades 3) Eight of Spades 4) Five of Hearts. The beautiful of this implementation is that one is able to create non-linear platform levels with the same cards andthis is the main motivation behind our project.</description>
