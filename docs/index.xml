      <description>We have made a food atlas based on augmented reality technology. This map can help people, especially children, understand and memorize the typical food of various places through having fun with the matching games. The user needs to recognize the map with the camera of the smartphone, and select the country they want to explore by clicking on the map. After starting the game, there are going to show five models of local specialties. The user needs to select the corresponding word card according to the model.</description>

      <description>ARcher The purpose of our application is to create an AR game that anyone can use in their home. In our case we use as basis the basic deck of card that almost everyone has. In our demo, we include 4 different kind of cards : 1) Ace of Spades 2) Two of Spades 3) Eight of Spades 4) Five of Hearts. The beautiful of this implementation is that one is able to create non-linear platform levels with the same cards andthis is the main motivation behind our project.</description>

      <description>Initial ideas&amp;hellip; I tried to implement this technique on a simple scene in unity and tested it myself. But It doesn’t work well and also bring me a lot fatigue by forcing my arm behind my shoulder. And I also tested with one of my friends and received some feedback from her. During our discussion and we thought to remove the moving back option and also augment the turning. 2nd Round Design&amp;hellip; In this version, player will only use their hand to control [rotation].</description>

      <description>New knowledge:  Last post mistake:
There are difference between tags and layers:
Tags are used for finding objects with a specific tag ( e.g. FindWithTag(str) ).
Layers can be used to identify objects at a high level.
  There are also other interesting tutorials to follow&amp;hellip;

      <description>Created a simple drawing application based on Qt toolkit (which I’ve tried to use in the Course Design of Data Structures in my undergraduate study). The application has an interactive interface which allows users to draw multiple shapes in different colors, line styles and thickness, by clicking buttons or dragging sliders. Users can also select an existing shape and move, resize or change attributes of it. It also allows users to read or save the images.</description>

      <description>Visualization Recommendation System This subject designs and implements a set of visualization scheme recommendation system. The system is oriented to data analysts whose requirements are not clear and who do not have professional programming capabilities. Through simple interactions, the system generates a series of visualization solutions that meet users’ needs. The design of the system is based on the actual analysis of visual element properties, attributes and real cases. By separating its data, properties and attributes, the corresponding relationship among them is studied and defined, and the model is established accordingly.</description>
