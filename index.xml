      <description>Qt Lab#3 : Statecharts Source code: https://github.com/winsa24/-QT-Microwave Introduction I implement the presentation and interaction control panel of a microwave oven on Qt.
1. Design the Statechart 2. Graphical interface In this part, I created a graphical interface by dragging and dropping based on Qt Designor. I used QLineEdit and QDial as display panel and slider.
3. Implement In this part, I first implement the QtStateMachine according to the Statechart shown in the first section. I created 9 states and use state-&amp;gt;addTransition() to link different states with different buttons.</description>

      <description>We have made a food atlas based on augmented reality technology. This map can help people, especially children, understand and memorize the typical food of various places through having fun with the matching games. The user needs to recognize the map with the camera of the smartphone, and select the country they want to explore by clicking on the map. After starting the game, there are going to show five models of local specialties. The user needs to select the corresponding word card according to the model.</description>

      <description>ARcher The purpose of our application is to create an AR game that anyone can use in their home. In our case we use as basis the basic deck of card that almost everyone has. In our demo, we include 4 different kind of cards : 1) Ace of Spades 2) Two of Spades 3) Eight of Spades 4) Five of Hearts. The beautiful of this implementation is that one is able to create non-linear platform levels with the same cards andthis is the main motivation behind our project.</description>

Layers can be used to identify objects at a high level.

      <description>Qt Lab #2: 2D Drawing Tool In this work, I completely finished a drawing application based on Qt toolkit by following all the instructions in Lab 2. The application has an interactive interface which allows users to draw multiple shapes in different colors, line styles and thickness, by clicking buttons or dragging sliders. Moreover, by clicking bottom buttons users can switch to editing part which allows users to select an existing shape and move, resize or change attributes of it.</description>

      <description>Created a simple drawing application based on Qt toolkit (which I’ve tried to use in the Course Design of Data Structures in my undergraduate study). The application has an interactive interface which allows users to draw multiple shapes in different colors, line styles and thickness, by clicking buttons or dragging sliders. Users can also select an existing shape and move, resize or change attributes of it. It also allows users to read or save the images.</description>

      <description>Visualization Recommendation System This subject designs and implements a set of visualization scheme recommendation system. The system is oriented to data analysts whose requirements are not clear and who do not have professional programming capabilities. Through simple interactions, the system generates a series of visualization solutions that meet users’ needs. The design of the system is based on the actual analysis of visual element properties, attributes and real cases. By separating its data, properties and attributes, the corresponding relationship among them is studied and defined, and the model is established accordingly.</description>
