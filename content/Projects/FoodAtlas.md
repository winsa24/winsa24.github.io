We have made a food atlas based on augmented reality technology. This map can help people, especially children, understand and memorize the typical food of various places through having fun with the matching games. The user needs to recognize the map with the camera of the smartphone, and select the country they want to explore by clicking on the map. After starting the game, there are going to show five models of local specialties. The user needs to select the corresponding word card according to the model. The system judges right or wrong by recognizing word cards, and the user needs to find five correct words to win the game.
