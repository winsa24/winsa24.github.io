# Initial ideas...
![rocketer](/images/courses/igd301/P4/rocketer.JPG)  
I tried to implement this technique on a simple scene in unity and tested it myself.  But It doesn’t work well and also bring me a lot fatigue by forcing my arm behind my shoulder. And I also tested with one of my friends and received some feedback from her. During our discussion and we thought to remove the moving back option and also augment the turning.

# 2nd Round Design...
![drive](/images/courses/igd301/P5/2nd.JPG)   
In this version, player will only use their hand to control [rotation]. To move forward, they can adjust a speed by pressing the index button. Here I set the minimal speed to 0, otherwise it will make the user move backward, which is confusing.
For turning left and right, user simply need to raise the opposite hand and lower the same side hand. 
# Errors...
Then I tried my first implementation but failed without adding rotate. I just changed the position along x axis, so it only move to left and right instead of rotate.

And also I made another error. In the scripts I remove the eye track direction which means I only have a fixed front eye view. I could rotate by moving my hand up and down but can’t go up. I think It is because the Camera doesn't have a rigidbody so it doesn’t follow the physical laws and have no reaction with the race track.

# 3rd Round Design
I tested the last version with one of my friend and found I can also improve with how people change the rotate speed. Although I set a button to do so, People will instinctively expand the range of arm movement in order to achieve the effect of increasing the rotation range.

So in the 3rd design, depending on the scale of your movement, you could rotate for either higher or lower speed.  Same as you click on the hand button.

# Evaluation
![eva](/images/courses/igd301/L6/myEva.png) 
For the evaluation, I invited 3 friends to test it. The result shows here have included the my score as well, we received an average time which is 84. It’s relatively longer because some of our testers want to explore the scene first instead of completing the game. 
And for the coins, I normally could collect more than 60 coins with a low speed. But others seem to have a hard time collect them. 
But overall all my testers said it’s a great game and they really enjoy it even though they will have some slight dizziness and even lasting for a moment after putting off the glasses.
Also there are some open feedback. After hearing these advices, I generate some new idea and made my last round modification. Due to the time limitation, they are not perfectly adjusted but I still think they are worth to be added.
