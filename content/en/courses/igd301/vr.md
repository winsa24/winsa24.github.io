[test on my Oculus](/images/VR/develop/handtrack.mp4)

**Problem met:**
    Ask for controller before entering the game. After entering the game, I can see my controller as virtual hands but can't pinch my finger.

>Try **ThumbStick** (AKA JoyStick?)

**Problem met:**
    Only the Left Hand ThumbStick works.
