# User Center Design (UCD)

## 
## 3 Constraints to Design : Task - Human - Technology

## Usability Criteria
- Ease of learning: learning cost / use of advanced functionalities  
- Recall: Remember how from one session to the next  
- Productivity: speed of execution  
- Fatigue (cf. repetitive actions)  
- Risk of errors: should be minimized, good feebcak needed otherwise  
- User satisfaction  
**Accessibility, functionality, time, effort, learnability, satisfaction, …**     


## Ideation
Brainstorm, Sketches....


## Prototype
>Methods: 
• Storyboards — good for user flow
• Paper prototypes — good for layout, flow
• Video prototypes — good for overall experience
• Powerpoint/Photoshop — Look ’n’ feel
• Software — functionality

## Evaluation  

#### Methods: 
>With users
• Logs  
• Questionnaires  
• Open-ended vs. Closed  
• Observation  
    • In-the-wild vs. in the lab  (ecological validity)  
• Think-Aloud
• Controlled Experiments
 
 Ecological validity — users; tasks; context ?
 
>Predictive(without users)   
• Cognitive Models
• Heuristic Evaluation
• Cognitive Walkthrough
