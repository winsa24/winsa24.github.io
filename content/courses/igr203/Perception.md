# Perception / Action
## Estimate interaction time :
### Fitt's law : **Pointing time** relies on D/W   ( Distance to target / Width of target)  
> Solutions:   
1. Reduce D : Popup menus / Attract applications or target   
2. Increase W : The Mac bar (border is infinite) / Marking menus (rely on angle)   
3. Mouse gain : mouse moving speed   
4. Semantic pointing : Common actions easy to reach while dangerous hard   
5. Avoid Pointing : Hotkeys / Gesture   
### Hick law : **Selecting time** relies on n (number of the options)  


# Colors
## Color models:  
### RGB : Additive model
Light emission (screens)   
• R, G, B primary colors  
• Each pixel has 3 subpixels  
Match the wavelengths detected by the cones   
Displays colors as we see them (not as they are!)  

### CMY(K) : Subtractive model
Light reflection (paper prints)
• Complementary colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow  
Printers: CMYK : CMY + blacK  
High-end printing (art books): 6 colors or more because of imperfect pigments  

### HSV  
Equivalent to RGB but more closely align with how we describe colors   
• Hue (teinte): primary color (wavelength)   
• Saturation = proportion of secondary colors  
• Value = brightness  
Variant: HSL Model (different calculation of S and L (light)) 

### CIE L*a*b
L: black to white
a: green to red
b: blue to yellow

### sRGB (**not a color model** but a color profile配置文件)   
• Color space created by Microsoft & HP
• Often used as a standard profile
• Used in CSS
• Some limitations: modern devices may have a larger gamut   


## Golden Rule  
• Contrast V (brightness) rather than H (hue)   
• Use at least a brightness ratio of 1/3 (1/10 if possible) between the background and the foreground   
• Human vision more efficient in the center of the spectrum (yellow, green)   
• Color vision deficiency

## Gamma correction  
>Problem: big difference between Luminance and Brightness
• Luminance: measurable quantity of light
• Brightness: perceived quantity of light 
Brightness = Luminance ^ n
