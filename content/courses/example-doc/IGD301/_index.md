>This UE presents an introduction to Augmented/Virtual and Mixed Reality challenges from an Human-Computer Interaction Perspective. The class covers an introduction to fundamental concepts of AR/VR/MR and presents methods and techniques allowing to design and implement interactive applications. The class is accompanied by a practical hands-on implementation and evaluation of a Virtual Reality application developed in Unity3D.
The class covers the following topics: History of AR/VR, Current technology enabling AR/VR and Human Perception, Challenge of Input, Challenge of Haptics, Interaction Design for AR/VR, Application Scenarios for AR/VR, Current Research Problems and Challenges from CHI, UIST, IEEE VR, ISMAR, SIGGRAPH.
