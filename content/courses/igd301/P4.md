## How to open a folder as a Unity Project
Double-clicking Scene file opens the project in unity. (It might cause crash of Unity).
Then restart hub and select a unity version for it.

## My Locomotion Technique ideas...

On class example for **presenting the idea**:
Target : Develop a **Swimming** Technique in VR
Requirements: Make user feel that they are **moving forward or backward**
Method: detect distance and have the matrix
Evaluate:  **Set a Goal**: perform best swimming experience

>
### Magnetiter
General idea: Throw a piece of magnetite and it will drag you to its position

### Rower
General idea: Reach forward and backward for moving forward. Tilt to one side for turning.

## Implementation process...(&Have fun with VR)
>Figure out how to screenshot and export them ^^

2. Click the **File** icon on the **top tool bar**
3. Clike the **Oculus** icon below
4. Then you will see the screenshots you took and click save icon, find a place on your computer:)

>Try **Hand Track**
follow [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMxD0EPfH9Q&list=RDCMUCG8bDPqp3jykCGbx-CiL7VQ&index=15) and test on my Oculus and made [extension developing](/images/VR/develop/handtrack2.mp4)

**Problem met:**
    Ask for controller before entering the game. After entering the game, I can see my controller as virtual hands but can't pinch my finger.

>Try **ThumbStick** (AKA JoyStick?)

follow [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSdfqOq_p5k)

[test on my Oculus](/images/VR/develop/thumbstick.mp4)

**Problem met:**
    All operation are mirrorred (opposite). 
    Only the Left Hand ThumbStick works.
